#Cancer Classification Machine Learning Project Based on Gene Expression Data

##Description

This project aims to classify various types of cancers using machine learning techniques on gene expression datasets. The objective is to identify gene expression patterns that differentiate between types of tumors, which can aid in improving cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies.

##Data
The data used in this project are is part of the RNA-Seq (HiSeq) PANCAN data set, it is a random extraction of gene expressions of patients having different types of tumor: BRCA, KIRC, COAD, LUAD and PRAD.

##Methods
The project involves the following key steps:
		Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the data to make it suitable for analysis.
		Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant genes that contribute to cancer classification.
		Model Development: Building and training machine learning models to classify the types of cancer based on gene expression data.
		Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
  
##Technologies Used
	•	Python for data processing and machine learning.
	•	Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for machine learning.
	•	Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development and data analysis.
